# Component 1 Documentation

This folder contains the individual files and the documentations for component 1. At present, this component has only two versions (standalone, and standalone conducted), and one further version (backing track) that is under development.

Component 1 is a generative composition written in the CHUCK language (https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/). In order to run the composition, you need to have CHUCK and miniAudicle installed. Installation files and installation instructions can be found here (https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/release/).
